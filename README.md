# SPI-Instrumentation-Controller-T4.1
SPI instrumentation Project:  Controller with Teensy 4.1 with 3.3V 500mA and 5V power

This is an enhacned controller card for the SPI instrumentaiton project.   Thare are now two (2) SPI interfaces plus a connector for the CCD sensor boards in the project, and the connectors compatible with keyed ribbon cable.  Additionally we have a 500mA 3.3V ldo on board to provide more power needed by the some of the sensor boards and especially if you are using a number of the newer daisy chain capable peripherals.

Here you will find the gerbers, drill and place files ready for fab, plus schematics.

As always, if you are building boards for your own lab, or having them made for your presonal use, these are free.   And of course, no guarantees of suitability for any purpose whatsoever.

Caveat, this a new design.  I have not built it yet.  Sponshorships are welcome.
