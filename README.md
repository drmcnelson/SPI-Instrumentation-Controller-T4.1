# SPI-Instrumentation-Controller-T4.1
SPI instrumentation Project:  Controller with Teensy 4.1 with 3.3V 500mA and 5V power

This is an enhanced controller card for the SPI instrumentaiton project.   There are two (2) SPI interfaces plus a connector for the CCD sensor boards and we have added a very low noise 500mA 3.3V LDO to provide more power to the sensor boards.  This will be useful as we roll out a new set of daisy chain capable instruments and sensors.

Here you will find the gerbers, schematics and bom files ready for fab.

As always, if you are building boards for your own lab, or having them made for your presonal use, these are free.   And of course, no guarantees of suitability for any purpose whatsoever.

Caveat, this a new design, not built yet.  Sponshorships are welcome.
